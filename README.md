## Abstract 
<p> 
The Heart Disease Prediction System is an innovative web-based application that leverages
machine learning to predict the risk of heart disease. Built with Django, this comprehensive
system offers three distinct user interfaces for patients, healthcare providers, and
administrators. The core system utilizes a Logistic Regression to analyze critical cardiovascular
health parameters to provide binary classification results (Healthy/Unhealthy).
Patients can input their health parameters through an intuitive interface and receive instant
predictions. Healthcare providers can monitor patients, access health histories, and make
predictions on their behalf. The system features secure user authentication, role-based access
control, prediction history tracking, and feedback management.
With its emphasis on data security and privacy, the system serves as a crucial tool in preventive
healthcare, enabling early detection of heart disease risk factors and efficient patient
monitoring, ultimately contributing to improved cardiovascular health outcomes.

## Introduction
<p>
  CardioBot: Heart Disease Prediction System is a web-enabled application that leverages
Machine Learning and Data Mining to forecast the likelihood of heart disease in patients. Heart
disease is a significant health concern worldwide, and its treatment can be highly costly. These
issues can be addressed through early detection by analyzing primary medical parameters such
as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other vital health factors.
Designed using Django, Python, and modern web technologies, the system provides a simple
user interface for medical professionals and patients. It is equipped with features such as a
doctor search facility, patient registration, disease prediction, and feedback mechanisms. The
backend utilizes advanced machine learning technique (Logistic Regression) to analyze patient
data and provide accurate predictions.
This project facilitates access to healthcare and make it more economical by providing an
intelligent system for early detection of heart disease. Early detection can lower healthcare
costs and improve cure rates through timely intervention.

### Aim
<p> 
  To predict heart disease according to input parameter values provided by user and dataset
stored in database.
</p>

### Objective
<p>
  The main objective of this project is to develop a heart disease prediction system. The system
can discover and extract hidden knowledge associated with diseases from a historical heart data
set Heart disease prediction system aims to exploit data mining techniques on medical data set
to assist in the prediction of the heart diseases.
</p>

### Project Scope
<p>
  The project has a wide scope, as it is not intended to a particular organization. This project is
going to develop generic software, which can be applied by any businesses organization.
Moreover it provides facility to its users. Also the software is going to provide a huge amount
of summary data.
