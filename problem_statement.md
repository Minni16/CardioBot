Problem Statement

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, with delayed detection often resulting in severe complications or fatal outcomes. While existing heart disease prediction systems exist, they present several critical limitations that hinder their effectiveness in real-world healthcare settings:

1. Accessibility Barriers: Current systems often require specialized medical knowledge to interpret results, making them inaccessible to the general public and limiting their preventive healthcare potential.

2. Data Management Challenges: Existing platforms typically focus solely on prediction without comprehensive data management capabilities, making it difficult to track patient history and monitor health trends over time.

3. Security and Privacy Concerns: Many current solutions lack robust security measures and role-based access control, raising concerns about sensitive medical data protection.

4. User Experience Issues: Available systems often feature complex interfaces that discourage regular use by both patients and healthcare providers.

The Heart Disease Prediction System addresses these limitations by providing:
- A role-based platform for patients, doctors, and administrators
- An intuitive interface accessible to both medical professionals and the general public
- Comprehensive data management with historical tracking and visualization
- Enterprise-grade security with role-based access control
- Real-time monitoring and automated risk alerts
- Integration of machine learning for accurate predictions

This system was developed to bridge the gap between early detection capabilities and practical healthcare delivery, enabling proactive heart health management through accurate prediction and systematic tracking of heart disease risk factors.
