The Heart Disease Prediction System is an innovative web-based application that leverages machine learning to predict heart disease risk. Built with Django, this comprehensive system offers three distinct user interfaces for patients, healthcare providers, and administrators. The core system utilizes a Gradient Boosting Classifier that analyzes 13 critical cardiovascular health parameters to provide binary classification results (Healthy/Unhealthy) with confidence metrics.

Patients can input their health parameters through an intuitive interface and receive instant predictions. Healthcare providers can monitor patients, access health histories, and make predictions on their behalf. The system features secure user authentication, role-based access control, prediction history tracking, and feedback management.

With its emphasis on data security and privacy, the system serves as a crucial tool in preventive healthcare, enabling early detection of heart disease risk factors and efficient patient monitoring, ultimately contributing to improved cardiovascular health outcomes.
